    <h1>Welcome to my photo gallery.</h1>
    <h3>Here, I will show pictures of my pets, who help my mental health.</h3>

    <!--Learned to do highlighting-->
    <p>These are pictures of Guppy, my cat and Kudo, my dog. Guppy is 6 years old and is <span style="background-color: #FFFF00;color:black;font-weight: bolder;">super</span> mellow and often times friendly.</p>
    <p>Kudo is a labredoodle and a little over a year old. He is very energetic and extremely friendly.</p>

                <p>Guppy on his pedestal, right next to the table. In this picture, he was here to keep us company while we ate our lunch.</p>

                <p>Guppy here is keeping me company and laying down on my bed with me. It's a bit of a blurry picture, but it shows he is friendly.</p>

                <p>Kudo on the stairs, with his favorite toy in his mouth. He is about 6 months old in this photo and would love to play tug of war with this toy.</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>While Kudo is super energetic, he is still a puppy and gets tired. Seeing him in either mood is therepeutic for me and helps me to relax and de-stress.</p>

    <h1>Welcome to my physical activity page.</h1>
    <h3>Here, I will talk about sports and working out.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>When I play sports, it's almost always ultimate frisbee, a non-contact spiritied sport.</p>
    <p>After practice every day, I feel good because it's spirtied, yet an environment where you are expected to perform and push yourself.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>A picture from me in a game.</h2>
    <img src="images/ingame.jpg" alt="alt text: me in game" style="width:70%">
    <p>Our team is 6-0 (undefeated). This is one of the best sports teams EPS currently has, and one of the best EPS ultimate Frisbee teams ever.</p>
    <p>Sports during fall is a great way or me to get away from homework and get some energy out of me before going home and working.</p>
    <p>I look forward to practice every day and will be sad in the winter when the school ultimate frisbee season is over and I won't have enough time for club sports.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Working out</h2>
    <p>Recently, I have been getting back into working out, especially arms as I enjoy that the most.</p>
    <p>Four months ago, in early June 2021, I got my own cage with olympic weights and bar at home, which made it much easier for me to workout whenever I wanted.</p>
    <p>I started out pretty weak compared to how strong I was before COVID and could go to the gym.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Video of me the day of getting the home gym.</h3>
    <video width="300" controls> <source src="videos/early-lifting.MOV" type="video/mp4"> </video>
    <p>Since then, I've worked hard to increase how much I can bench press and can now do the weight in the video for 15 reps instead of one.</p>
    <p>I look forward to working out often and feel accomplished after working hard. Due to it being at home, it is pretty easy for me to take a quick break from whatever i'm working on to lift.</p>
    <p>I'm proud of how much work I've put in and the results I've seen. It has greatly helped my mental health to work towards a physical goal of increasing my personal records.</p>

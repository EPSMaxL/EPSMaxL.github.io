    <h1> Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <h3>Here, I will discuss ways I help myself.</h3>
    <p>Self care comes in many different forms.</p>
    <p>I will mostly focus on physical and emotional self-care.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>My physical self-care is from playing sports every day after school.</h3>
    <p>I like playing ultimate frisbee in my free time.</p>
    <img src="images/ultimate.jpg" style="width:500px">
    <p>I play for the school varsity team and when I have more time, will tryout for high level club Ultimate frisbee.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>My mental self-care comes from time with friends and from baby animals.</h3>
    <p>I will go into detail for both of these more on my other webpages.</p>
    <p>Below are my two pets, Guppy the cat and Kudo the dog.</p>
